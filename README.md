==

This repository contains the starter code for project 2 (15-440, Fall 2016).
These instructions assume you have set your `GOPATH` to point to the repository's
root `p2/` directory.

This project was designed for, and tested on AFS cluster machines, though you may choose to
write and build your code locally as well.

## Starter Code

The starter code for this project is organized roughly as follows:

```

## Instructions

### Compiling your code

To and compile your code, execute one or more of the following commands (the
resulting binaries will be located in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory):

```bash
go install github.com/cmu440/tribbler/runners/srunner
go install github.com/cmu440/tribbler/runners/lrunner
go install github.com/cmu440/tribbler/runners/trunner
go install github.com/cmu440/tribbler/runners/crunner
```

To simply check that your code compiles (i.e. without creating the binaries),
you can use the `go build` subcommand to compile an individual package as shown below:

```bash
# Build/compile the "tribserver" package.
go build path/to/tribserver

# A different way to build/compile the "tribserver" package.
go build github.com/cmu440/tribbler/tribserver
```

##### How to Write Go Code

If at any point you have any trouble with building, installing, or testing your code, the article
titled [How to Write Go Code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) is a great resource for understanding
how Go workspaces are built and organized. You might also find the documentation for the
[`go` command](http://golang.org/cmd/go/) to be helpful. As always, feel free to post your questions
on Piazza.

### Running your code

To run and test the individual components that make up the Tribbler system, we have provided
four simple programs that aim to simplify the process. The programs are located in the
`p2/src/github.com/cmu440/tribbler/runners/` directory and may be executed from anywhere on your system.
Each program is discussed individually below:

##### The `srunner` program

The `srunner` (`StorageServer`-runner) program creates and runs an instance of your
`StorageServer` implementation. Some example usage is provided below:

```bash
# Start a single master storage server on port 9009.
./srunner -port=9009

# Start the master on port 9009 and run two additional slaves.
./srunner -port=9009 -N=3
./srunner -port=9010 -master="localhost:9009"
./srunner -port=9011 -master="localhost:9009"
```

Note that in the above example you do not need to specify a port for your slave storage servers.
For additional usage instructions, please execute `./srunner -help` or consult the `srunner.go` source code.   

##### The `lrunner` program

The `lrunner` (`Libstore`-runner) program creates and runs an instance of your `Libstore`
implementation. It enables you to execute `Libstore` methods from the command line, as shown
in the example below:

```bash
# Create one (or more) storage servers in the background.
./srunner -port=9009 &

# Execute Put("thom", "yorke")
./lrunner -port=9009 p thom yorke  
OK                                 

# Execute Get("thom")
./lrunner -port=9009 g thom 
yorke

# Execute Get("jonny")
./lrunner -port=9009 g jonny
ERROR: Get operation failed with status KeyNotFound
```

Note that the exact error messages that are output by the `lrunner` program may differ
depending on how your `Libstore` implementation. For additional usage instructions, please
execute `./lrunner -help` or consult the `lrunner.go` source code.

##### The `trunner` program

The `trunner` (`TribServer`-runner) program creates and runs an instance of your
`TribServer` implementation. For usage instructions, please execute `./trunner -help` or consult the
`trunner.go` source code. In order to use this program for your own personal testing,
you're `Libstore` implementation must function properly and one or more storage servers
(i.e. `srunner` programs) must be running in the background.
   
##### The `crunner` program

The `crunner` (`TribClient`-runner) program creates and runs an instance of the
`TribClient` implementation we have provided as part of the starter code.
For usage instructions, please execute `./crunner -help` or consult the
`crunner.go` source code. As with the above programs, you'll need to start one or
more Tribbler servers and storage servers beforehand so that the `TribClient`
will have someone to communicate with.

##### Staff-compiled binaries

Last but not least, we have also provided pre-compiled binaries (i.e. they were compiled against our own 
reference solutions) for each of the programs discussed above.
The binaries are located in the `p2/sols/` directory and have been compiled against both 64-bit Mac OS X
and Linux machines. Similar to the staff-compled binaries we provided in project 1,
we hope these will help you test the individual components of your Tribbler system.

### Executing the official tests

#### 1. Checkpoint
The tests for checkpoint are provided as bash shell scripts in the `p2/tests_cp` directory.
The scripts may be run from anywhere on your system (assuming your `GOPATH` has been set and
they are being executed on a 64-bit Mac OS X or Linux machine). For example, to run the
`libtest.sh` test, simply execute the following:

```bash
$GOPATH/tests_cp/libtest.sh
```

Note that these bash scripts link against both your own implementations as well as the test
code located in the `p2/src/github.com/cmu440/tribbler/tests_cp/` directory. What's more, a few of these tests
will also run against the staff-solution binaries discussed above,
thus enabling us to test the correctness of individual components of your system
as opposed to your entire Tribbler system as a whole.

#### 2. Full test

The tests for the whole project are provided as bash shell scripts in the `p2/tests` directory.
The scripts may be run from anywhere on your system (assuming your `GOPATH` has been set and
they are being executed on a 64-bit Mac OS X or Linux machine). For example, to run the
`libtest.sh` test, simply execute the following:

```bash
$GOPATH/tests/libtest.sh
```

Note that these bash scripts link against both your own implementations as well as the test
code located in the `p2/src/github.com/cmu440/tribbler/tests/` directory. Similarly, a few of these tests
will also run against the staff-solution binaries discussed above,
thus enabling us to test the correctness of individual components of your system
as opposed to your entire Tribbler system as a whole.

If you and your partner are still confused about the behavior of the testing scripts (even
after you've analyzed its source code), please don't hesitate to ask us a question on Piazza!

### Submitting to Autolab

To submit your code to Autolab, create a `tribbler.tar` file containing your implementation as follows:

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cmu440
tar -cvf tribbler.tar tribbler/
```

## Miscellaneous

### Reading the starter code documentation

Before you begin the project, you should read and understand all of the starter code we provide.
To make this experience a little less traumatic, fire up a web server and read the
documentation in a browser by executing the following command:

```sh
godoc -http=:6060 &
```

Then, navigate to [localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/cmu440/tribbler](http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/cmu440/tribbler)
in a browser (note that you can execute this command from anywhere in your system, assuming your `GOPATH`
is set correctly).

### Using Go on AFS

For those students who wish to write their Go code on AFS (either in a cluster or remotely), you will
need to set the `GOROOT` environment variable as follows (this is required because Go is installed
in a custom location on AFS machines):

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/depot/go
```
